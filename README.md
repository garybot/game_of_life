My first implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
## UPER
### Understand

The rules of Conway's Game of Life are fairly simple:

    If the cell is alive and has 2 or 3 neighbors, then it remains alive. Else it dies.

    If the cell is dead and has exactly 3 neighbors, then it comes to life. Else if remains dead.
